## Tips & tricks

1. When entering a password in a terminal, if you realize there's a typo, type `ctrl + u` to undo the password just entered and enter it again.

2. Escaping strings in bash using `!:q` (TODO)

3. reverse search (TODO)

4. Hiding passwords in scripts (TODO)

5. Create a simple chat with `netcat` (TODO)

6. Bash allows you to ignore history entries that begin with a space if you set the `HISTCONTROL` variable to `ignorespace`. Type a space before a command before running it in the bash shell and the command will run normally, but won't appear in your history if you have this variable enabled. This allows you to keep your history a bit cleaner, choosing to run commands without them appearing in your history. Bash also allows you to ignore duplicate commands that can clutter your history. To do so, set `HISTCONTROL` to `ignoredups`. To use both the ignorespace and ignoredups feature, set the `HISTCONTROL` variable to `ignoreboth`.

7. Always check if a piece of hardware is compatible with Linux, before buying it. For printers, have a look at this [list](https://haydenjames.io/finding-linux-compatible-printers/) or check the [OpenPrinting](https://www.openprinting.org/printers/) database. A recent project which aims  help people to collaboratively debug hardware related issues, check for Linux-compatibility and find drivers is [Hardware for Linux](https://linux-hardware.org/). If you are currently not able to write your own printer driver but you have some interest in it, consider starting from [here](https://openprinting.github.io/documentation/02-designing-printer-drivers).

9.  Find out neighbours in your local network: `sudo nmap -sn 192.168.1.0/24`

11. Use floating-point arithmetich in bash: `bc <<< 'scale=2; 61/14'`

12. Encrypt your emails with [GnuPG](https://emailselfdefense.fsf.org/en/) to protect yourself from mass surveillance.

15. Capture (unencrypted) HTTP traffic on localhost with nc, e.g.:
```
# listen fon incoming communication on a specific port in a shell
:~$ nc -l 8080
# send a request to this port from another shell in your machine
:~$ curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"hello": "world"}' http://localhost:8080
# return to the main shell to see the received request
:~$ nc -l 8080
POST / HTTP/1.1
Host: localhost:8080
User-Agent: curl/7.68.0
Accept: */*
Content-Type: application/json
Content-Length: 18

{"hello": "world"}
```

16. Beware of commands with the same name, especially command shell built-in vs external command as `time`:
```bash
:~$ type -a time
time is a shell keyword
time is /usr/bin/time
time is /bin/time
```

Use the full path to execute to not execute the built-in command:
```bash
/usr/bin/time [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARG]...
#or
/bin/time [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARG]...
```

17. Take a screenshot from the command line on a X Window System (with `imagemagick`): `sleep 5; xwd -root | convert xwd:- test.png`

18. Cat without cat: `echo "$(<file.txt)"` (credits [@jarv](https://jarv.org/posts/cat-without-cat/))

19. On bash, you can relaunch a command along with its args and flags by using the esclamation mark, e.g.: `!gcc` will re-execute the last occurence of `gcc` in the shell history.

20 Again, on bash, `!!` will re-execute the very last command in shell history. That's very handy, especially when you just forget to prefix a command with `sudo`: in this case you can simply run `sudo !!`.
